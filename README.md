# JS2 CA

![image](/images/js2ca.jpg)

## Description

This is my assignment for the JS2 CA. It is based on the former CSS Frameworks CA. The site is a social media application called "SOME app", meant to make it easier to follow your favorite blog-influencers. SOME app is made to look clean and simple without too much clutter.

### Dependencies

I have used Bootstrap and SASS for this assignment.

I have used a trello-board at Trello.com to plan and schedule this CA for myself:
